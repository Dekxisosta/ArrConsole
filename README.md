## Program Requirements
The program is to perform the following operations:
- Count and display the number of occurrences of an element in the array
- Display the indices of all occurrences of an element
- Display the elements with duplicates
- Display the most occurring element in the array
- Display the first non-repeating element in the array

## Limitations
- No advanced data structures like Objects, HashMaps, etc.
- No built-in methods and commands to manipulate the array

## Sample Console Output
